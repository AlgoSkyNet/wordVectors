\title{Plot a Vector Space Model.}
\usage{
\S4method{plot}{VectorSpaceModel}(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The model to plot}

\item{y}{(ignored)}
}
\value{
The TSNE model (silently.)
}
\description{
Visualizing a model as a whole is sort of undefined. I think the
sanest thing to do is reduce the full model down to two dimensions
using T-SNE, which preserves some of the local clusters.
}
\details{
This plots only the first 300 words in the model.
