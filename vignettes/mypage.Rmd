```{r}
library(wordVectors)
library(magrittr)

model = read.vectors("~/Dropbox/lib/R/hum2vec/cookbooks.bin")
```

```{r}
model
```

Anything in the grey boxes will saved for later.

To create another grey box, just copy and paste an existing one. Or type out the characters by hand.

```{r}
model %>% nearest_to(model[["fish"]])
```

With that list, you can expand out further to search for multiple words:

```{r}
model %>% 
  nearest_to(model[[c("fish","salmon","trout","shad","flounder","carp","roe","eels")]],50)
```
